# AI-Driven Development — 30 Day Challenge  
> By Nabeel Ali

## 📍 Project Overview  
This repository holds my journey and work for the **30-Day Challenge** of "AI-Driven Development". Over the course of 30 days I aim to explore, implement and document different AI-driven development techniques, tools and tasks. Each day features a distinct task, milestone or deliverable in PDF format (or similar), enabling me to build skills and show progress.

## 🧾 Contents  
- `AIDD-Task-1.pdf` — Day 1 deliverable  
- `AIDD-Task-2.pdf` — Day 2 deliverable  
- `AIDD-Task-3.pdf` — Day 3 deliverable  
- *(and so on…)*  
- `.gitattributes` — Git attribute settings  
- *(future files as the challenge progresses)*

## 🎯 Objectives & Goals  
- Learn and apply **AI-assisted development workflows**, e.g., prompt-engineering, code generation, automated testing, intelligent debugging.  
- Document outcomes clearly (via PDFs) to track what was done, what succeeded, what didn’t, and what next steps are.  
- Build a portfolio of real tasks showing hands-on experience with AI-driven development geared for full-stack/Next.js/TypeScript workflows (which align with my skills & interests).  
- Share insights and reflections at the end of the challenge to help others learning similar paths.

## 🔧 Technologies & Skills  
- **Core Stack**: Next.js, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (since I am a developer focusing on these technologies)  
- **AI/ML Tools & Concepts**: (examples) prompt engineering, LLMs, code-generation tools, AI-powered dev assistants  
- **Workflow & Documentation**: GitHub for version control, PDF deliverables for each task, README for project overview  
- **Design Style**: I prefer a simple, dark, unique theme for UI work and code samples — consistent with my brand.
