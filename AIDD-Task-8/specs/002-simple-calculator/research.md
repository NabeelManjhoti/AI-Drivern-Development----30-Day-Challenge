# Research for Simple Calculator

## Decision: Programming Language

- **What was chosen**: Python 3.10+
- **Rationale**:
    - Ease of development and rapid prototyping for a simple CLI application.
    - Strong community support and extensive libraries (e.g., `argparse` for CLI, `pytest` for testing).
    - Cross-platform compatibility, aligning with the target platform.
    - Good readability and maintainability for this project's scope.
- **Alternatives considered**:
    - C# .NET 8: Considered for its robust CLI tooling and performance, but Python offers quicker development for this simple task.
