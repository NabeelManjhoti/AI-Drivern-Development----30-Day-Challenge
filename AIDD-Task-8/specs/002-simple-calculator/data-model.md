# Data Model for Simple Calculator

This project, a simple command-line interface calculator, does not involve complex data models or persistent storage. The "entities" primarily consist of input numbers (integers or floating-point) and operators (+, -, *, /), which are processed transiently during each calculation. Therefore, a detailed data model is not applicable.
